Hello and welcome to this small project :3.

This is a copycat Snake game made by me in C++.

I am also new at GitHub and I'm trying my best to learn the platform, please don't break anything around here, thank you.

Known bugs:
1. There is currently no input handling for something other than what is requested in the game. Will not fix.
2. Not many comments. Will not fix either.

Solved bugs:
1. Loading a save would count as an instant loss.
2. It was possible to make the snake go from one direction to it's opposite (e.g LEFT -> RIGHT) instantly.
3. Pressing continue from main menu after loss would continue broken playthrough.
4. High score not registering.

Added features:
1. Stopwatch for each playthrough (if loaded from save, only counts current playtime).
2. Customized all "Game over" menus for each scenario (quitting, saving, losing).

Sorry for the ugly UI, C++ doesn't really allow for anything visually pleasing.

If you have any questions, message me either here or on discord: Annannas#2709

Will not update this project anymore.
