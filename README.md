Hello and welcome to this small project :3

This is a copycat Snake game made by me in C++

I am also new at GitHub and I'm trying my best to learn the platform, please don't break anything around here, thank you.

Known bugs:
1. Game goes to an instant Game Over screen after choosing to continue the game due to a death or upon saving.
2. The statistics aren't showing the total playtime (not really a bug but it's more of a missing feature, I'll add it soon.)

Solved bugs:
1. Loading a save would count as an instant loss
2. It was possible to make the snake go from one direction to it's opposite (e.g LEFT -> RIGHT) instantly.

Currently working on adding comments to the code and fixing the bugs.
Sorry for the ugly UI, C++ doesn't really allow for anything visually pleasing.
